            <span class="emphasis">As stated before, the DOM is simply an object. It is no different than the objects you create in OOP.</span> The DOM represents our entire HTML page. It provides, like objects do, properties and methods that allow us to <span class="emphasis">create</span>, <span class="emphasis">read</span>, <span class="emphasis">update</span>, and <span class="emphasis">delete</span> various pieces of our HTML page.
          </p>

          <p class="content">
            The <span class="emphasis">HTMLElement</span> is an <span class="emphasis">object</span> representing your HTML tag. The HTMLCollection is a collection of <span class="emphasis">HTMLElements</span>. The <span class="emphasis">NodeList</span> is a collection of every node. This includes all the HTMLElement nodes and Text nodes that may be apart of the collection.

            <h3>Objects</h3>
          </header>

          <p class="content">
            In standard <span class="emphasis">Object Oriented Programming</span>, <strong>Classes</strong> are created as blueprints of attributes and functionality. The attributes and functionality are better known as <span class="emphasis">Properties</span> and <span class="emphasis">Methods</span>. If we want a subset of those methods an properties we can create a new class that inherits from the class and adjust the visibility using public, private, and protected visibility modifiers. This is the process in Java, PHP, C++, Ruby, and many other languages.
          </p>

          <p class="content">
            <span class="emphasis">HOWEVER</span>, JavaScript doesn't use classes, it uses object prototypes exclusively. (Yes I know about the ECMAScript CLASS structure, but this still uses prototyping under the hood). We can create our own objects easily:</span>
          </p>
          
          <ol id="objectExample">
            <li>Create a new object called person.</li>
            <li>Give you object a name, age, gender, and an array of interests.</li>
            <li>Give your object a function called greeting and have it output a welcome message.</li>
            <li>Give your object a function called bio and have it output their name, age, gender and interests in a logical sentence.</li>
            <li>Call the greeting().</li>
            <li>Call the bio().</li>
            <li>Output the name and age.</li>

            <h3>HTMLElement Properties and Methods</h3>
          </header>

          <p class="content">
            An <span class="emphasis">HTMLElement</span> is an object that represents your HTML tag. In HTML a tag describes its content. For example, &lt;article&gt; tells the browser that the content contained inside is semantically connected to an article. JavaScript doesn't care about semantics, but it does care about the tag name. Every HTML tag will become an HTMLElement in the DOM. In addition, the HTMLElement inherits properties and methods from various other objects available: <span class="emphasis">Element</span>, <span class="emphasis">Node</span>, and <span class="emphasis">EventTarget</span> objects. This means we have many properties and methods available to us to work with our HTMLElement.
          </p>

          <ol start="8">
            <li>Select and store the &lt;h1&gt; element.</li>
            <li>Change the text content of the h1 element object.</li>
            <li>Change the text colour of the h1 element object.</li>
            <li>Make the h1 object text uppercase</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="content">
            The last step's syntax is an interesting demonstration of prototypal inheritance:

            <br><br><span class="emphasis">
              h1.textContent = h1.textContent.toUpperCase();
            </span><br><br>
            
            h1 is an object. textContent is a property of h1. textContent's value is a string (which is actually a text node object). The text node object inherits from String. That is why we have access to the String method <span class="emphasis">.toUpperCase()</span>. This whole line contains a lot of objects giving us a lot of capability.
          </p>

          <p class="content">
            This leads to another important concept in JavaScript: <span class="emphasis">A variable/property value can be of any type!</span> That includes <span class="emphasis">Numbers</span>, <span class="emphasis">Strings</span>, <span class="emphasis">Booleans</span>, <span class="emphasis">Arrays</span>, <span class="emphasis">Objects</span>, and <span class="emphasis">Functions</span>. That means a property of an object can have the value of an entire other object, and in regards to the DOM, often does!

            <h3>HTMLCollection/NodeList Properties and Methods</h3>
          </header>

          <p class="content">
            A <span class="emphasis">NodeList</span> is an object. It acts much like an <span class="emphasis">Array</span> object as it contains a <span class="emphasis">zero-index</span> list of node elements. In this case, the list is entirely made up of HTMLElements and text nodes.
          </p>

          <p class="content">
            When you select multiple HTMLElements using <span class="emphasis">.querySelectorAll()</span> you will be returned a <span class="emphasis">NodeList</span> object. In addition, an individual <span class="emphasis">HTMLElement</span> will contain a property called <span class="emphasis">childNodes</span> that has a NodeList object as a value. If it isn't obvious, this NodeList contains all the children HTML elements under the selected element.
          </p>

          <ol id="css-selector-examples" start="12">
            <li>Select and store the first &lt;ol&gt; element in the HTML document.</li>
            <li>Select an store the property's value that contains a NodeList.</li>
            <li>Select an store the property's value that contains an HTMLCollection.</li>
            <li>What is the difference between the two collections values?</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="content">
            HTMLCollections and NodeList behave much like arrays, however there are some differences between each. For example, iterating through an HTMLCollection can be achieved with a <span class="emphasis">for loop</span>and a <span class="emphasis">for/of loop</span>, or by using a while/do while structure or recursion. It does not have access to the method <span class="emphasis">.forEach()</span> though. NodeLists can use any of the iterator methods including the <span class="emphasis">.forEach()</span> method. This is another reason that <span class="emphasis">.querySelectorAll()</span> is so cool as it <span class="emphasis">ALWAYS</span> returns a NodeList.
          </p>

          <ol start="16">
            <li>Using a for/of loop, iterate through the children and output the text content of each child.</li>
            <li>Using a .forEach() loop, iterate through the children and output the text content of each child.</li>
            <li>Why do you think there are large gaps in between each child's output for Step 15?</li>
          </ol>
